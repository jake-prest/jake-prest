🌩️ I specialize in designing and delivering high-impact solutions using AWS services (Lambda, Connect, API Gateway, etc.) and enjoy guiding teams through complex migrations, integrations, and skills transformations.

🎓 I’m passionate about teaching and breaking down complex technical concepts—helping over 1,000 enterprise staff upskill through custom cloud learning journeys.

📱 Currently building a toddler language development app (with AI integration) as a side project with my wife, a speech therapist—blending my tech background with our shared passion for early childhood development. This repo is currently private.
